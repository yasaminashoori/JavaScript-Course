 ### 1. Hello World
   To access the developer console in Chrome, press Ctrl + Alt + J or go to the Menu and select View > Developer > Developer Console. The console is used by developers to test and write JavaScript code to fix errors and find bugs. The alert('text') function can be used to display a message in the console.
   Note: developer console used for: test and write js code to fix errors and find the errors.

For example, you can assign the value 'amazing' to the variable js using the code "let js = 'amazing'". Then, you can use an if statement to check if js is equal to 'amazing', and display a message using the alert() function if it is. Finally, you can assign the value 'boring' to js using the code "js = 'boring'".

JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language. It is high-level, which means that you don't need to worry about managing memory and other complex tasks. It is also multi-paradigm, which means that it can be used for different programming structures.

JavaScript can be used outside of the browser on a web server, as well as on the front-end of web applications. The latest version of JavaScript, ES6, has huge updates and changes and is called modern JavaScript. It receives yearly updates. It is recommended to learn ES5 before starting with ES6.

 ### 2. What is Javascript?

JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language. It is considered high-level because the programmer does not need to worry about managing memory and other complex tasks. JavaScript is also multi-paradigm, meaning it can be used for different structures of code.

JavaScript can be used outside of browsers on web servers, as well as on browsers as front-end applications. ES6 (also known as "modern JS") has many updates and changes, and is updated yearly. It's recommended to learn ES5 before starting with ES6.

To create the script tags in JavaScript code, we can use the following code:

<script> </script>

It's important to note that good coding practice involves alerting the user that JavaScript is being used. Also, the value is the smallest unit of information in JavaScript.

Variables in JavaScript can only contain numbers, letters, underscores, and dollar signs, and cannot start with a number.
