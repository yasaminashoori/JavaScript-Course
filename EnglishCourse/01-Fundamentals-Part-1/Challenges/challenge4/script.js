// Coding Challenge #4

/*
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's 
tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// The first solution wit error: script.js:24 Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'tip' before initialization at script.js:24:11

// const bill = 275;
// const tip =
//   bill >= 50 && bill <= 300
//     ? console.log(
//         `The bill was ${bill}, the tip ${0.15 * bill} and the final value ${
//           tip + bill
//         }`
//       )
//     : console.log(
//         `The bill was ${bill}, the tip ${0.2 * bill} and the final value ${
//           tip + bill
//         }`
//       );

// second way
const bill = 275;
const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
console.log(`bill: ${bill} tip ${tip} and total: ${tip + bill}`);
